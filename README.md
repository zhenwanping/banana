## Editing Components

To edit a component, navigate to the `src/components/` directory and open the corresponding `.astro` file. For example, to edit the `Header` component, open `src/components/Header.astro`.

Astro components use a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or TypeScript). You can modify the markup, styles, and logic within these files to customize the appearance and behavior of the components.
